						<img src="images/me.jpg" style="float:right;width:320px;height:220px;" />
						My name is Kristopher Kath, and I love learning how to create video games for people to enjoy.
						I started my journey into video game development 5 years ago by pursuing a Computer Science
						degree at CSU, Long Beach.
						I have experience creating video games in Unity and in Unreal Engine.
						I've had the opportunity to work with organizations such as Girls Make Games & Games for Love,
						and I hope to do more in the future!
						I recently graduated in the Fall of 2021 and now I am on the look out for jobs in the games
						industry.
						I hope that you find my work enjoyable, and thank you for visiting!
